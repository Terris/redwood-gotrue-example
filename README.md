# RedwoodJS GoTrue Auth Example

An example [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com/) Auth example using Netlify Identity as a provider and [GoTrue](https://github.com/netlify/gotrue)/[GoTrue-JS](https://github.com/netlify/gotrue-js) as a client.

The example includes sign up, confirm email, sign in, sign out, and reset password abilities.

Note that in local environments, the recovery and confirmation token hashes will need to be copied from the email redirect and pasted at the end of the local root URL, i.e. http://localhost:8910/#recovery_token=12345

Further walkthrough coming soon.
